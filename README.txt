This is a collection of Project Euler solutions that I compile as I go through the series. It's a bit of a 'get to know my languages' project. I come from a Python background and will focus on those first, then work on them in C. Java is the third language I will implement.

Most of these are original. Credit was given for those that aren't. Some are the product of collaboration.
